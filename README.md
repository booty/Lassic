Lassic
======

Templating and utilities for ASP Classic / VBScript.

While nobody in their right mind would write a ASP "Classic" project today, sometimes we have to maintain old sites and applications. :)

Lassic is a simple, fast templating engine that can marge with database records and can also do some conditional logic tricks.
